# NixOS Configuration
Declarative system configuration for my computer running the NixOS Linux distribution.

"hardware-configuration.nix" is ignored as it is computer dependent and has no reason to be tracked or downloaded. "local.nix" is ignored because it contains nix settings dependent on location, which can change without meaningfully changing the system.
